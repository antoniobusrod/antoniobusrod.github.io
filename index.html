<p>I am an experienced backend software engineer related to the design, development, scalability, and reliability of services on the Internet, most of them implemented with Python. Moreover, I also focus on people management and product strategy as a team lead at Primer.</p>
<p>I live close to Valencia, Spain. I enjoy outdoor activities like water sports, hiking, and cycling. At home, I also like playing electric guitar and reading. Most importantly, I love spending time with my family and friends.</p>
